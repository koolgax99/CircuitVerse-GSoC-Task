# CircuitVerse-GSoC-Task
<br>

In this I have implemented the Google Classroom Button in the CircuitVerse website. If the student has saved his simulation he can submit the link of the saved Circuit to his teacher through Google Classroom just by clicking the Google CLassroom Icon.

<br>

Steps to follow after clicking the Google Classroom Icon in the CircuitVerse Website:
* Select the classroom you wish to share the Circuit to
* Select the Assignment to which you want to attach the Circuit Link
* Once chosen, the link of the circuit is already attached to the Classroom. The student has to just `Turn In` the assignment.
* Now the CircuitVerse circuit is submitted to the teacher.
